It is the implementation of some parts of the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08934
There is a big gap between my results for the greedy algorithm for GFM and the papers' results. Moreover, I think almost all of the times for a large number of big random testcases, the average competitive ratio will be very near to (e-1)/e=0.632; therefore, with a very good approximation, we can skip the offline part of the code and make it much more faster.
